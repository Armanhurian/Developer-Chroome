        We welcome Solidity power users, auditors, security experts and tooling developers to get involved and actively contribute to the Solidity language design process.

                        Join the Solidity forum, where existing properties of the language and proposals for new language features can be discussed.
                        
                        Give input by completing (feature) feedback surveys which are regularly distributed via Twitter and the forum.
                        
                        Join the dedicated language design discussion calls, in which selected topics, issues or feature implementations are debated in detail.
                        
                      
                   
        Or share your thoughts and take part in design discussions directly via relevant Github issues.

        For ad-hoc inquiries and questions you can reach out to the core team using the solidity-dev Matrix channel (currently also still available on Gitter), a dedicated chatroom for conversations around the Solidity compiler and language development.
        The Solidity Summit is a free interactive forum for people involved and interested in the Solidity language and the ecosystem around it.
        After a first virtual Solidity Summit in 2020, we met in person for the second Solidity Summit in 2022 in Amsterdam.

Solidity Summits usually feature talks & discussions on Solidity, Yul, language design and tooling. The event series aims to...

Enable useful (language-design related) discussions which result in improvement proposals and actual implementations.

Foster communication between teams working on similar topics.

Identify needs for the smart contract ecosystem for Ethereum.
